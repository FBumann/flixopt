## üöÄ Purpose

**flixopt** is a Python-based optimization framework designed to tackle energy and material flow problems using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP).

**flixopt** bridges the gap between high-level energy systems models like [FINE](https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/FINE) used for design and (multi-period) investment decisions and low-level dispatch optimization tools used for operation decisions.

**flixopt** leverages the fast and efficient [linopy](https://github.com/PyPSA/linopy/) for the mathematical modeling and [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) for data handling.

**flixopt** provides a user-friendly interface with options for advanced users.

It was originally developed by [TU Dresden](https://github.com/gewv-tu-dresden) as part of the SMARTBIOGRID project, funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (FKZ: 03KB159B). Building on the Matlab-based flixOptMat framework (developed in the FAKS project), flixOpt also incorporates concepts from [oemof/solph](https://github.com/oemof/oemof-solph).

## üì¶ Installation

Install flixOpt via pip.
`pip install flixopt`
With [HiGHS](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS?tab=readme-ov-file) included out of the box, flixopt is ready to use..

We recommend installing flixOpt with all dependencies, which enables additional features like interactive network visualizations ([pyvis](https://github.com/WestHealth/pyvis)) and time series aggregation ([tsam](https://github.com/FZJ-IEK3-VSA/tsam)).
`pip install "flixopt[full]"`

## üõ†Ô∏è Solver Integration

By default, flixOpt uses the open-source solver [HiGHS](https://highs.dev/) which is installed by default. However, it is compatible with additional solvers such as:  

- [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/)  
- [CBC](https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc)  
- [GLPK](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/)
- [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer)

For detailed licensing and installation instructions, refer to the respective solver documentation.
