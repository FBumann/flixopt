## [Unreleased]

## What's New

### Scenarios
Scenarios are a new feature of flixopt. They can be used to model uncertainties in the flow system, such as:
* Different demand profiles
* Different price forecasts
* Different weather conditions
They might also be used to model an evolving system with multiple investment periods. Each **scenario** might be a new year, a new month, or a new day, with a different set of investment decisions to take.

The weighted sum of the total objective effect of each scenario is used as the objective of the optimization.

#### Investments and scenarios
Scenarios allow for more flexibility in investment decisions.
You can decide to allow different investment decisions for each scenario, or to allow a single investment decision for a subset of all scenarios, while not allowing for an invest in others.
This enables the following use cases:
* Find the best investment decision for each scenario individually
* Find the best overall investment decision for possible scenarios (robust decision-making)
* Find the best overall investment decision for a subset of all scenarios

The last one might be useful if you want to model a system with multiple investment periods, where one investment decision is made for more than one scenario.
This might occur when scenarios represent years or months, while an investment decision influences the system for multiple years or months.


### Other new features
* Balanced storage - Storage charging and discharging sizes can now be forced to be equal in when optimizing their size.
* Feature 2 - Description

## [2.1.2] - 2025-06-14

### Fixed
- Storage losses per hour where not calculated correctly, as mentioned by @brokenwings01. This might have lead to issues with modeling large losses and long timesteps. 
  - Old implementation:     $c(\text{t}_{i}) \cdot (1-\dot{\text{c}}_\text{rel,loss}(\text{t}_i)) \cdot \Delta \text{t}_{i}$
  - Correct implementation: $c(\text{t}_{i}) \cdot (1-\dot{\text{c}}_\text{rel,loss}(\text{t}_i)) ^{\Delta \text{t}_{i}}$

### Known issues
- Just to mention: Plotly >= 6 may raise errors if "nbformat" is not installed. We pinned plotly to <6, but this may be fixed in the future.

## [2.1.1] - 2025-05-08

### Fixed
- Fixed bug in the `_ElementResults.constraints` not returning the constraints but rather the variables

### Changed
- Improved docstring and tests

## [2.1.0] - 2025-04-11

### Added
- Python 3.13 support added
- Logger warning if relative_minimum is used without on_off_parameters in Flow
- Greatly improved internal testing infrastructure by leveraging linopy's testing framework

### Fixed
- Fixed the lower bound of `flow_rate` when using optional investments without OnOffParameters
- Fixed bug that prevented divest effects from working
- Added lower bounds of 0 to two unbounded vars (numerical improvement)

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Restructured the modeling of the On/Off state of Flows or Components
  - Variable renaming: `...|consecutive_on_hours` → `...|ConsecutiveOn|hours`
  - Variable renaming: `...|consecutive_off_hours` → `...|ConsecutiveOff|hours`
  - Constraint renaming: `...|consecutive_on_hours_con1` → `...|ConsecutiveOn|con1`
  - Similar pattern for all consecutive on/off constraints

## [2.0.1] - 2025-04-10

### Added
- Logger warning if relative_minimum is used without on_off_parameters in Flow

### Fixed
- Replace "|" with "__" in filenames when saving figures (Windows compatibility)
- Fixed bug that prevented the load factor from working without InvestmentParameters

## [2.0.0] - 2025-03-29

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Complete migration from Pyomo to Linopy optimization framework
- **BREAKING**: Redesigned data handling to rely on xarray.Dataset throughout the package
- **BREAKING**: Framework renamed from flixOpt to flixopt (`import flixopt as fx`)
- **BREAKING**: Results handling completely redesigned with new `CalculationResults` class

### Added
- Full model serialization support - save and restore unsolved Models
- Enhanced model documentation with YAML export containing human-readable mathematical formulations
- Extend flixopt models with native linopy language support
- Full Model Export/Import capabilities via linopy.Model
- Unified solution exploration through `Calculation.results` attribute
- Compression support for result files
- `to_netcdf/from_netcdf` methods for FlowSystem and core components
- xarray integration for TimeSeries with improved datatypes support
- Google Style Docstrings throughout the codebase

### Fixed
- Improved infeasible model detection and reporting
- Enhanced time series management and serialization
- Reduced file size through improved compression

### Removed
- **BREAKING**: Pyomo dependency (replaced by linopy)
- Period concepts in time management (simplified to timesteps)
